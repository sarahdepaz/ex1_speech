DTW
=========

Python implementation of DTW.

What is it?
-----------

The celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) [1] defines the discrepancy between
two time series, of possibly variable length, as their minimal alignment cost.
Although the number of possible alignments is exponential in the length of the
two time series, [1] showed that DTW can be computed in only quadractic time
using dynamic programming.


How to Run the code
------------
run:
    python3 ex1.py
